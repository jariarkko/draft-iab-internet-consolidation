Section 1

Throughout the document, the British English 's' and American English 'z'
spelling conventions alternate, e.g. in Section 1 (Introduction), "it seems to
also feed the creation of large, centralised" and "something is concentrated
in the small set of organizations".  As I understand it, either is acceptable,
but RFC 7322 recommends sticking with one convention.

Also, the phrase "The engineering remit" is used.  (I realize it comes from
(https://www.ietf.org/blog/consolidation/?primary_topic=6&); more on that
later.  I'm not sure what is meant by "remit" here.  Do you mean "payment"
(a common English definition)?

Section 2

In Section 2 (Other Work), and at other places in the draft, you use single
quotes (') instead of double quotes ("") to quote cited text.  I checked
RFC 7322 again, which gives double quotes as examples.

The text about Adam Smith could use a citation.  I believe it comes from
THE WEALTH OF NATIONS, which is available (in individual chapters) at
https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/The_Wealth_of_Nations.

Section 3

With regards to the 60% web browser figure given in the ISOC report, I would
separate it out and provide the link to the StatCounter page
(http://gs.statcounter.com/browser-market-share) as a citation.  Perhaps I am
biased, but from past experience (I did web traffic analysis for AltaVista),
I tend to be skeptical about certain claims about web traffic.  At the very
least, anyone who reads the RFC (if published) would be able to go directly to
the StatCounter site, and judge for themselves whether their methodology meets
statistical muster.

Perhaps what is meant by "anyone with an account at any email server can use
it globally" should be clarified.  Is this a statement about how effectively
one can use email to communicate with others?  If so, the following statement
about spam prevention services would tend to negate that (because smaller
email services are either more vulnerable to spam or are less "politically"
vulnerable to (undeserved) anti-spam mitigation).  Perhaps another way to put
this is that the "openness" of email may be perceived as an advantage (because
one does not have to sign up with a social media or some other "walled garden"
to communicate with its members), but the proliferation of spam has moved users
onto these "walled gardens" that are perceived to be, but may not be less
vulnerable to spam.

I would say the statement "The more users a service has, the more data is
available for training machine learning models ..." may be true, but is not
guaranteed to be true.  Perhaps a better statement is "the more data is
potentially available ..."

A citation for attacks against Dyn, such as
https://krebsonsecurity.com/2016/10/ddos-on-dyn-impacts-twitter-spotify-reddit/
would be helpful.

Section 5

The blog article could use a citation.  I assume it is
https://www.ietf.org/blog/consolidation/?primary_topic=6&.  Also, I would say
it is based on the blog article, if the RFC text (eventually) differs from
the article.
